## Overview
Batter Up! is a fast-paced, browser-based, two-player baseball-inspired game designed for both local and online multiplayer. Inspired by the minigames of It Takes Two, Batter Up! challenges your timing, reflexes, and coordination as you and a friend compete to rack up the highest score in a unique, circular batting arena.

## How to Play
### Objective:
Hit the moving ball with your bat when it enters the green "hit zone" to score points. The player with the most points when the timer runs out wins!

### Controls:
- **Red Player:** Hold and release `A` to swing
- **Blue Player:** Hold and release `L` to swing

### Zones:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green Zone:** Perfect timing â€“ scores a point and increases ball speed
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow Zone:** Miss â€“ reduces ball speed
- ðŸ”´ **Red Zone:** Too early â€“ reverses ball direction and reduces speed

### Modes:
- **Local Multiplayer:** Both players play on the same keyboard
- **Online Multiplayer:** Host a private room and share the code, or join a friend's room for real-time online play

## Features
- **Peer-to-Peer Online Multiplayer:** No servers required! Connect directly with a friend for low-latency, real-time gameplay
- **Host-Controlled Game Settings:** The host can adjust:
  - Base Ball Speed
  - Speed Increment per Hit
  - Maximum Ball Speed
- **Visual Hit Zones:** Red, yellow, and green arcs show miss, too early, and perfect hit zones
- **Session Leaderboard:** Tracks the results of your last 10 games (scores, winners, and time played)
- **Responsive UI:** Works on desktop and most modern browsers
- **Background Customization:** Supports custom background images/GIFs
- **Audio Feedback:** Satisfying hit sounds for every successful swing
- **Debug Info (for devs):** Toggleable debug overlay shows ball angles, speed, and current hit zone
